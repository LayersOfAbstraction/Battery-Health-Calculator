# Battery Health Calculator

As the Windows commandline utility `powercfg /batteryreport` does not specify the total degradation of your laptop battery, you can use this fomular to do that.

DesignCapacity / FullChargeCapacity * 100 = current recgarge percentage.

But having to work out to prove why a client needs their laptop fixed  can be a pain sometimes which is why I made an interactive easy to use calculator that does that for you. Simply input the specified values to see the overall charge capacity. My calculator has advanced error handling in case you bump into issues. Please feel free to share any issues with me and please share the log file that generates upon using this application.
